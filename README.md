# Emotive-Robot-Companion
Emotive Robot Companion. The robot Ada is capable of responding by movement to simple keywords from the users, using two separate aspects. The first is a speech recognition algorithm, using **Machine Learning** on an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense as the cognitive side, built on [Edge Impulse](https://www.edgeimpulse.com/). The second is to use this Arduino chip to control a **physical robot**, known under the name of Otto, able to move around accordingly to what was understood.
